    <h2>File Format</h2>
    <p>The file must be a CSV (comma-separated values) file with the following fields, in that order (do not include
        a header row, just make sure they are in this order):</p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>name, unit, brand, description, serial number, asset tag, express service code, quantity,
minimum re-order quantity, quantity on order, minimum vendor quantity, last order date, price,
category, location, PR/PO number, account number, supplier/vendor, calibration/service date,
end-of-life date, notes, service records, user, date shipped, in-use</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The fields <pre>name, unit, category</pre> are required.  All others are optional, but a column must be included for
        them.</p>
    <h3>Notes for specific fields:</h3>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Field(s)</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unit</td>
        <td>Use the abbreviation for the given unit.  For example, the Faculty of Applied Sciences abbreviation is
            "APSC". Computing Science is "CMPT", Engineering is "ENSC", Sustainable Energy Engineering is "SEE". Don't
            worry about capitalization, the code will check regardless.  This is at most 4 characters and will be
            automatically truncated if you put in one that is too long.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All dates</td>
        <td>The code will do its best to parse any common format.  You can use YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY/MM/DD, or even write
            it out, e.g. 'January 25th, 2057', or anything similar.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Category</td>
        <td>You must use one of our internal categories, the same ones visible in the drop-down when adding a single
            asset via the system.  They are: Swag, Brochures, Events, General, Office Supplies, Teaching, Research,
            Admin Support, Tech Support, and Electronics.  Don't worry about capitalization, the code will check
            regardless.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All quantities</td>
        <td>These should be whole numbers, obviously, not partials.  E.g. "4", not "4.3".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Price</td>
        <td>Either a whole or floating number will work.  Do not add the dollar sign.  E.g. "4.5", "4", all work.  If
        you've added more than 2 decimals (if the value was calculated, for example), the value will be rounded
        properly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>User</td>
        <td>You can supply either an employee ID (the 9 digit ID), or a user ID (not an email alias or role account).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>In-Use</td>
        <td>Any case-insensitive version of "Yes", "True", "Y", "T", "1" will be considered as being in use.  Either
            leaving that field blank or putting any other value will be considered as not in use.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>All other fields are just plain text fields, and you can put in basically what you'd like in them. If you put in
    longer blocks of text than what the regular form would let you, they will be truncated.</p>
